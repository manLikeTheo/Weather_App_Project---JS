# Weather_App_Project---JS
This Weather App Project was created with HTML, CSS and JS and WEBPACK

Take Note that data was first Hard-Coded before dynamically adding required elements from the API call and adding them to the DOM

Made use of concepts taught in previous lessons on Promises, Fetch API, Async-Await and Webpack

Just the Basic Functionality for now. Didn't feel the need to take too much time in building a perfect project.

However, you can fetch weather from any location by making city queries to the Weather API using city names.

Note: Data On-loading the webpage are hard-coded placeholder data.

Still a lot of improvement to be made on this project. Will get back to that at a later time.
